# Buggy-Cars-Rating-Manual
This project showcases my beginner-level manual testing efforts performed on the **Buggy Cars Rating** website, an open-source, practice-oriented platform designed for software testing. The objective was to simulate real-world testing scenarios using a structured approach to identify issues and document test cases and bugs.

## Project Overview

**Tested Website:**  
[Buggy Cars Rating Website](https://buggy.justtestit.org/)

**Purpose:**  
- Gain hands-on experience in manual testing.
- Learn to document test cases and bugs using industry-standard templates.
- Understand basic testing concepts like scenario design, bug reporting, and prioritization.

## Contents

- **Test_Cases_BuggySite.xlsx**: A collection of over six test cases targeting critical modules such as Login, Registration, Profile, Car Rating, and UI responsiveness.
- **Bug_Report_BuggySite.xlsx**: A detailed report of identified bugs, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and severity/priority levels.

## Project Details

### Test Cases
The test cases cover major functionalities of the website:
- **Login Module:** Valid and invalid login attempts.
- **Registration Module:** New user registration, ensuring proper validation and redirection.
- **Profile Module:** Editing and updating user details.
