# Buggy-Cars-Rating-Manual
This project showcases my beginner-level manual testing efforts performed on the **Buggy Cars Rating** website, an open-source, practice-oriented platform designed for software testing. The objective was to simulate real-world testing scenarios using a structured approach to identify issues and document test cases and bugs.

## Key Features Tested
- Login/Logout flow
- Car rating submission
- Page navigation (Popular, Overall, etc.)
- Form validation
- UI/UX behavior in Chrome browser
